# Machne Learning Baed Anomaly Detection for V2X Wireless Traffic

This is a study of the performance of various machine learning models on detecting anomalous behaviour in a Internet of Vehicles V2X (Vehicle to Everything) context. Training was done on the CICIov2024 dataset. More information can be found before.

This study was conducted to stasify the requirements of CSCI4179/CSCI6711 - Intelligent Wireless Networks final project.
